# Troubleshooting

* Here is the detailed guide on how to download and install GLFW, build it, then build the project
** Download the necessary files
*** Download glfw from homepage
*** Download the glfw 32-bit binaries as well (you'll need these later)
** Copy directory to the project's 'libraries' directory and rename 'win_glfw' 
** Open cmake-gui
*** For source, use the directory you just copied
*** For build directory, create 'build/' inside the 'win_glfw' directory and use that
*** Click configure
**** Change CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to the 'win_include_lib' in the project's 'include' directory (if there are already folders in there, delete them)
**** Click configure again
*** Click generate
** Go to the build directory created in 'win_glfw'
*** Open the .sln file
**** If your current VS configuration isn't set up like this already, change the platform toolset of the ALL_BUILD project to 'Visual Studio 2015 (v140)' (or whatever VS year you are using)
**** Change the build type to Release
**** Build the ALL_BUILD project
**** Change the Platform Toolset for the INSTALL project as above
**** Copy the contents from 'lib-vc2015' (located in the glfw binaries zip you downloaded earlier) into '../win_glfw/build/src/Release' (you will probably have to create the Release directory)
**** Build the INSTALL project
** Open cmake-gui (again)
*** Set the source directory to your project and the build directory to the new one you will create now in the project directory
*** Click configure
*** Click generate
*** Navigate to the .sln file in the build folder of your project and open it
*** Make sure all projects have the appropriate platform toolset selected and...
*** BUILD!

You should now have an .exe file in you build/Debug (or Release, depending on what you selected).
